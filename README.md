ultraYumm helps users select high energy and low weight foods for long distance hiking and packing.

## Motivation
Current food and menu planning apps are focused on weight loss and/or calorie minimization. None are specifically designed to assist with long term planning for users seeking maximum energy and ultra-light packing. When I last planned a hiking menu for my family of 4, I struggled with clunky spreadsheets and having to scrape the web for key information. I hope this app is useful to hikers and traveler like me who need to keep everyone energized and happy with as little weight carried as possible!

## Current Features
- Search for any food or brand name
- Results are ranked by highest calorie per 100gram ratio
- Results include: food name, brand name or "common" food designation, serving quantity, serving unit, calories per serving unit, weight per serving unit and calories per 100grams
- Print results
- Create one or multiple trips with name, start and end date, url and travelers
- Push search items to selected trip, with option to assign to a specific date, traveler or meal type
- All pushed item fields can be edited and customized, most importantly serving quantities
- Trips results table shows all items assigned to a specific trip with the total sum of calories and weight for all items displayed 
- Items can be deleted from trip results table
- Custom items can be created and assigned to a trip
